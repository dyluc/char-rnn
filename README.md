# Character-level RNN for Text Generation

A few implementations of character-level Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to generate text. The model is trained on a corpus of text data and can generate new text sequences that mimic the style of the input data.

## Project Structure

`datasets/` - Contains the text data used for model training, including a dataset of synthetic "Yoda-like" language and the complete scripts of the Star Wars original trilogy.

`main.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook used for experiments, training and model evaluation.
